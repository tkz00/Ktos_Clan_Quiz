To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

For the openai request to be successful you need to get a key from platform.openai.com and set it as the env var `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
